### API/JSON Documentation

The application uses JSON files (posts.json, trending.json) in the data/ directory to store post data. Below is the structure of a post:
code
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user": "John Doe",
    "handle": "@johndoe",
    "profilePic": "Cric.jpeg",
    "content": "Exploring the beauty of nature.",
    "category": "forYou",
    "likes": 10,
    "retweets": 2,
    "comments": [],
    "isRetweeted": false,
    "isLiked": false
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "user": "Jane Smith",
    "handle": "@janesmith",
    "profilePic": "cricket.jpeg",
    "content": "Excited for the new tech conference!",
    "category": "forYou",
    "likes": 8,
    "retweets": 1,
    "comments": [],
    "isRetweeted": false,
    "isLiked": false
  }
]
  These JSON files simulate an API, providing data for posts and user interactions.

Code: (trending.json)
```json
{
  "trendingTopics": [
    "#CSKvsRCB",
    "#SupremeCourtOfIndia",
    "#Budget2025",
